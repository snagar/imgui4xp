The folder contains all the needed libraries to compile freetype2 on VS 2019 (what I tested)

All files are compressed in:   brotoli_and_freetype_libs_and_dlls.zip
The zip file contains:
brotlicommon.dll
brotlicommon.lib
brotlidec.dll
brotlidec.lib
brotlienc.dll (not needed)
brotlienc.lib (not needed)
freetype.lib
freetyped.lib


Copy these libraries files "*.dll" to your win.xpl folder

========== VS optional DLLs ========
All DLLs are compressed in: "optional_VS_dlls.zip" file.
It contains the following files:
vcruntime140_1d.dll
ucrtbased.dll
msvcp140d.dll
